"""Run the idempotent January SL/VL annual-accrual batch.

Purpose:
- Add the current year's Vacation Leave and Sick Leave credits.
- Use 15 days for employees below five completed service years on January 1.
- Use 17 days for employees with at least five completed service years.
- Carry the previous year's unused SL/VL into Beginning Credit.
- Avoid duplicate credits when the command is run more than once.

The Streamlit leave pages call the same processing automatically. This script
is provided for an explicit January batch or Windows Task Scheduler job.

Examples:
    python -m scripts.process_january_leave_accrual
    python -m scripts.process_january_leave_accrual --year 2027
    python -m scripts.process_january_leave_accrual --company-code DEFAULT
